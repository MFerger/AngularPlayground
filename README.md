# AngularPlayground

1. First I went to the Angular documentation online
2. Found an example similar to what was assigned
3. Tested it out and added some styling with bootstrap
4. Added webpack.config.js for npm run dev command to serve locally


How to run locally:

1. Fork clone this repo.
2. run '$ npm install' in the terminal to get devDependencies
3. While in the same directory, run the command '$ npm run dev'
4. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/
5. See the live site!
